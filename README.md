# DSA-project
DSA project 
Just run it if you have visual studio, 
else 
compile every source file in /src, /glad, /imgui
then link appropriate library in /glfw , also link opengl32.lib , which is already in os
these are the external include folders :
    glad, glfw, glm, imgui, khr, stb
Output will be generated in out folder
out folder has shaders and data folders, that are required, so run from in there
If platform is not windows, then glfw should be compiled, also appropriately opengl libraries for os
