# Tree Of Flight

A flight control simulator/visualizer made as a project for our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) class. 

Implementations of pathfinding and graph traversal algorithms.   
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A-star algorithm
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search

## Compiling

**For Windows**  
> Open solution in Visual Studio and run.  
>**OR**  
>Compile using build.bat (uses clang)

If platform is not windows, then glfw should be compiled, also appropriately opengl libraries for os.

## Some sample images  

You can count on Dijkstra to get you places efficiently..

Or you can go on a world tour with DFS!
